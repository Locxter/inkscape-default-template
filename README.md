# Locxter's Inkscape default template
This repository includes my personal Inkscape default template (1920x1080 pixels with all alignment tolls activated) and scripts to install it on Windows and Linux.  
Please note that the scripts always change the default template system-wide and not only for your current user, therefore the need to be run as administrator.

## How to install it on Windows
Simply execute the `install.bat` script as administrator and you should be read to go.

## How to install it on Linux
Simply execute the `install.sh` script as administrator and you should be read to go.
